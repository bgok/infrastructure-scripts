# Infrastructure-Scripts

Infrastructure-scripts provide all the scripts required to `build`, `start`, and `deploy`
[infrastructure-components](https://github.com/infrastructure-components/infrastructure-components).

It is like "react-scripts" within "react-starter".


## Installation

This lib contains many libraries that you only need during development/deployment. Thus, install this library
as devDependency:

```
npm install --save-dev infrastructure-scripts
```

This library uses the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) that you need to install globally.

```
npm install -g serverless
```

You can install [infrastructure-components](https://github.com/infrastructure-components/infrastructure-components) easily

```
npm install --save infrastructure-components
```

Finally, apps (e.g. single-page-app, isomorphic-app) and components (environment, webapp) can have further dependencies.
Have a look at them in [our documentation](https://infrastructure-components.readthedocs.io).
